 <h1 class="quote1">Zendaya</h1> 
 <p class="quote4">My quote from Zendaya that I find most inspiring is “I think women are very powerful and 
     I think we're more powerful together than separated.” <a href="https://www.inspiringquotes.us/quotes/cLyR_L0bMEH7u">Source</a> The reason I find this so inspiring 
     is because many women do not want to work together but attack each other. I think if we 
     worked together more often and wanted to change things together we would change many 
     different things together.</p>

 <h1 class="quote2">Hunter Schafer</h1>
     <p class="quote4">My quote from Hunter Schafer that I truly love is "No matter what I've worked 
         on or what art practices I've delved into, they've always been an attempt to world-build." <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/hunter_schafer_1018742">Source</a>
         The reason I love this so much is she is a truly inspiring transgender icon making her path
         with the show Euphoria and I believe that she is truly going to change the world some day. 
         She is very passionate about saving the world and changing the views everyone holds.

 <h1 class="quote3">Barbie Ferreira</h1>
     <p class="quote4">My quote from Barbie Ferreira that I've chosen here is "Curvy and plus-size models 
      will just be models once it becomes more normalized and we get more representation 
      and people are used to it and not shocked by it." <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/barbie_ferreira_913196">Source</a> I chose this one because I think it 
      very important to never single anyone out for gender, weight, height or race. I think
      no one should have to deal with labels for weight especially. I think if you are a model,
      you are simply a model and should never have to deal with another label just for weight. </p>
